Simple implementation of TicTacToe. 1 Player can play againt an AI. The AI is trained using Q-learning.

The Project consists of one file called TicTacToe. The file contains two classes: a player(named Player) class and a game (named TicTacToe) class. The player class contains the player logic and the game class contains the game logic.
Download the script and run it. Running the script invokes 100000 training episodes of the Q - Agent. After the game is started and you are able to play the game in the console. 
If you wish to omit the training sequence just outcomment the function train(100000) in the file. Without training you will play against an agent who chooses his moves randomly.
